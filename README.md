# Roman Numeral conversion in RISC-V assembler
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>   

This RV32 program converts Roman numerals and numbers to Arabic numbers. It is
based on the RARS 1.6 Assembler and Runtime Simulator at
[https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars). It
follows the _subtractive_ notation where IV is 4, though _additive_ Roman
numbers will be converted as well.
